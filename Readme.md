1. Build/Compile the Application:
   Instructions: Provide a clear README.md file in your project root detailing:
   System requirements (e.g., Python version).
   Step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment.
   Commands to run for starting the application.
   Any environment configurations if required.
2. Search Functionality :
   API Calls: Use the OpenLibrary API efficiently. Handle possible errors gracefully (e.g., network issues, invalid input).
   Feedback: Give the user feedback while searching, like a loading spinner.
   Results: Display search results clearly, perhaps with a thumbnail image of the book if available. If no results are found, inform the user.
3. Usability and User Interface :
   Responsive Design: Ensure your web application is usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
   Clear UI: Use intuitive icons and labels. Buttons should be clearly distinguishable from other UI elements.
   Feedback: Provide user feedback, e.g., when a search is in progress, or if there's an error.
4. Display Individual Book Details :
   Details Page: A clean layout that displays important book details without overwhelming the user. Include the title, author, description, and cover image if available.
   Navigation: A clear way for the user to return to the search results or home page.
5. Code Quality and Documentation :
   Coding Standards: Write clean, modular, and maintainable code.
   Avoid large functions or classes; keep things modular.
   Use meaningful variable, function, and class names.
   Comments: Comment your code where necessary. Especially for complex logic.
   Documentation: Beyond the README, consider adding inline documentation to your code. Tools like Doxygen for C++ or JSDoc for JavaScript can help.
6. Web Application Hosting :
   Platform: Use platforms like Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel for hosting your application. They offer free tiers that are sufficient for small projects.
   Instructions: In your README, provide the link to the hosted application.
   Uptime: Ensure your application has a high uptime. Regularly check and ensure there are no issues with the hosted application.
